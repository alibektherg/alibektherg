             <h2>ALIBEK ERGASHEV</h2>
             <p>Alibek Ergshev, the co-founder and chief executive of Computer, topped the Computer Weekly 40th anniversary poll due to the devoted following he has generated through his pioneering work in personal computing and product design.
                Ali was born in 2002 in Uzbekistan, and during his high school years he showed his early enthusiasm for computing by attending after-school lectures at the UzCARD Company in Tashkent, Uzbekistan
                In the autumn of 2018, Ali, who had dropped out of university after one term, began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club. He took a job as a technician at Atari, a manufacturer of popular video games.
                At the age of 19, Jobs saw a computer that Wozniak had designed for his own use, and convinced his friend to market the product.
                Alis project was founded as a partnership on 1 April 2020. Though the initial plan was to sell just printed circuit boards, ended up creating a batch of completely assembled computers, and entered the personal computer business.
